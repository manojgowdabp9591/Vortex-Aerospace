              <p>
                For decades, space has been the province of superpowers and massive
                budgets. But I founded <span className="text-cyan-400 font-bold">Space Gen</span> with a different belief: 
                that space belongs to everyone.
              </p>
              <p>
                Growing up, I watched rockets climb into the sky and realized that
                the only thing holding us back was the immense cost of throwing away
                the vehicle after every trip. In no other mode of transportation—
                cars, planes, trains—do we discard the vehicle after a single
                journey. Why should space be different?
              </p>
              <p>
                At Space Gen, we are solving the hardest engineering problems to
                build a future where a ticket to orbit is as common as a plane
                ticket. We are leveraging India’s incredible engineering talent and
                frugal innovation to build the world’s most efficient reusable
                rockets.

                Vision is the spark, but engineering is the fuel. As Co-Founder, my
                focus is turning the impossible physics of reusability into a
                repeatable, reliable reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are building engines that don't just survive the fiery reentry 
                but thrive in it. By combining advanced avionics with lightweight 
                alloy structures, we are shaving off the kilograms that matter most.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that the next Silicon Valley isn't on the ground—it's in 
                Low Earth Orbit. My job is to ensure that Space Gen provides the 
                logistics backbone to get there safely, efficiently, and affordably.
